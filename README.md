# THE TASK

Utilizing the OpenLibrary API, please produce a simple book search engine that shows the top 10 book results for a given search term.
Docs to the OpenLibrary API here https://openlibrary.org/developers/api

### Things to Note

1. Calls the endpoint and makes sure it returns typed data to make use of the endpoint easier. Also doing the reduction of the data on the endpoint end to keep component clean.
2. Everything is clearly named what it actually is to make to easy to understand what is happening on the page


### Things todo in the future

- add unit tests
- add better styling for the table. Larger cells to deal with large amount of text
- Use more felids off of the OpenLibrary. Namely the cover image values
- Have a way to look at a detailed information about a book. (maybe click and raise a model over the page)
